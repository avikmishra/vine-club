### Event of the month

September 2017 event was organised at Mr Hemant Ojha and Dr Abha Ojha's house. Excellent couple and excellent hosts. Hemant bought two new decanters and showed us the way how the red wine should be served properly. We have now decided to introduce all the members one variety of grape and one region each month. The grape of the month for September was Cabernet Sauvignon and the region Bordeaux in France. The two wines we sampled were from the AOC(appellation d'origine contrôlée)  Pauillac and Margaux two small villages located in the wine region of Haut Medoc. These two along with Saint Jullien, and somewhat lesser known Saint Estephe, Listrac and Moulis are the most popular and highly rated wine regions of Bordeaux.

##### Pauillac

Very nice full bodied wine with lots of dark fruit and smooth lasting tannins. Earthy savory flavor with dark cherry finish. A classy Pauillac at a very reasonable price.

##### Margaux

Full bodied with a taste of ripe fruits, spicy, well balanced with soft tannins and a touch of oak. Would like to try again in future.

### Wine regions

##### Bordeaux AOC￼

Bordeaux is the world's major wine industry capital. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo. The Bordeaux region is naturally divided by the Gironde Estuary (an estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of saline water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it) into a Left Bank area which includes the Médoc and Graves and a Right Bank area which includes the Libournais, Bourg and Blaye. The Médoc is itself divided into Haut-Médoc (the southern portion) and Bas-Médoc (the northern portion, often referred to simply as "Médoc").

There are various sub-regions within the Haut-Médoc, including St-Estèphe, Pauillac, St.-Julien and Margaux and the less well known areas of AOC Moulis and Listrac. Graves includes the sub-regions of Pessac-Léognan and Sauternes (among others), and Sauternes in turn includes the sub-region of Barsac. There is an additional wine region of Entre-Deux-Mers, so called because it lies between the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, which combine to form the Gironde. This region contains several less well known sweet wine areas of Cadillac and St. Croix de Mont.

All of these regions have their own appellation and are governed by Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) laws which dictate the permissible grape varieties, alcohol level, methods of pruning and picking, density of planting and appropriate yields as well as various wine making techniques.

The permissible grape varieties in red Bordeaux are: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. While wine making styles vary, a rule of thumb is that the Left Bank is predominately Cabernet Sauvignon based with the Right Bank being more Merlot based. The Graves area produces both red wine (from the grapes previously mentioned) and white wine from the Sauvignon blanc, Sémillon and Muscadelle grapes. The area of Sauternes (including Barsac) is known for its dessert wines.

### Grapes

##### Cabernet Sauvignon

This is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.

Despite its prominence in the industry, the grape is a relatively new variety, the product of a chance crossing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc during the 17th century in southwestern France. Its popularity is often attributed to its ease of cultivation—the grapes have thick skins and the vines are hardy and naturally low yielding, budding late to avoid frost and resistant to viticultural hazards such as rot and insects—and to its consistent presentation of structure and flavours which express the typical character of the variety. Familiarity and ease of pronunciation have helped to sell Cabernet Sauvignon wines to consumers, even when from unfamiliar wine regions. Its widespread popularity has also contributed to criticism of the grape as a "colonizer" that takes over wine regions at the expense of native grape varieties.

The classic profile of Cabernet Sauvignon tends to be full-bodied wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity that contributes to the wine's ageing potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates the blackcurrant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olive notes while in very hot climates the currant flavours can veer towards the over-ripe and "jammy" side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have a characteristic eucalyptus or menthol notes.
