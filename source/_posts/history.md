The credit for forming this exclusive red wine club must go to our founder president Dr Kishore Gupta who originally conceived this idea way back in 2007....

### What we do

<!-- more -->

All the members meet  on the first Friday of every month. The attendance has always been good. Everyone in fact keenly look forward to this evening in preference to other events in their social calendar. We sample red wines from different regions and different grapes each month. The president and the secretary informally introduce the wine, the vineyard and the region and invite each members impression and comments. However the primary goal and function of this club has always been to hobnob with our close friends and enjoy the evening.
